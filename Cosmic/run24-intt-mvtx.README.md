# INTT and MVTX cosmic runs

## Trigger descriptions

Some of these runs include the TPC and were rate limited to 30 Hz with wide, horizontal cosmics. Some runs excluded the TPC and used vertical narrow triggers which increased the rate to ~75 Hz with significantly improved efficiency, at least a 10x improvement. The MVTX was operated with an 89 microsecond strobe length (readout window)
